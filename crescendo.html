    <b>5.</b> I love the time we've spent together and the experiences we've shared. When you first start dating, there's not too much to go off of in terms of affection. Rather, it's a mix of surface-level things such as physical attractiveness or resume quality along with early indicators of whether spending time together in the future will be enjoyable. What I think makes affection substantial is the realization of spending time together, and I've been enjoying my time with you a whole ton. All the first-times, all the world traveling, all the randomly wasting time while procrastinating -- they were all done together. That's something precious to me.
