    <b>3.</b> I love it when you get excited planning activities - it feels great how we complement each other in planning travel. A list of activities in particular that I loved:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>That first real Costa Rican meal we had in San Jose.</li>
    <li>Horseback riding (it was not fun afterwards though).</li>
    <li>Holding your hand during whitewater rafting (and then jumping off :P).</li>
    <li>That car ride through the middle of nowhere (+ 2 rivers) in Costa Rica.</li>
    <li>Jet skiing in the Costa Rican sunset.</li>
    <li>Poledancing in Montreal.</li>
    <li>Going to a spa for the first time.</li>
    <li>The first wine + something added tasting in Rome.</li>
    <li>Eating six truffle-laden dishes in a row.</li>
    <li>Beef + sour carrots in Tibet (went with guide so it counts).</li>
    <li>Going above 5000m in elevation.</li>
    <li>Date night in Chengdu.</li>
    <li>Climbing up underground waterfalls in New Zealand.</li>
    <li>The first minute of skydiving (lol).</li>
    <li>Jetskiing (+ a bit of grinding) in Fiji.</li>
    <li>Parasailing in Fiji.</li>
    <li>Watching you shop in Sydney.</li>
    <li>Fencing in Shanghai (minus the losing part).</li>
  </ul>
