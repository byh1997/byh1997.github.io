    Since shipping is prohibitively expensive, physical tokens of affection will be replaced with an electronic tokens of affection. In particular, here is a list of some things I love about you <3.

    <b>1.</b> I love how I can travel with you for almost a month and still can't get enough. Usually, I feel the need to gtfo and recharge after within a week. With you, however, time together is recharge time. There's no pressure to always be talking or doing anything; rather, we can relax together in between activities. I love cuddling too <3. Physical contact is definitely something I'm only comfortable with with you (i.e. I tend to avoid hugs, etc.), and I love every touch.

    These won't come freely :P you can get to the next one once you find the number of positive integers less than 10^12 of the form [p*p + p], where p is a prime. By the way, all url's will be [0-9a-z]*.
