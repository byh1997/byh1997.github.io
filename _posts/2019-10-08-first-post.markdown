Welcome to my new blog! I'll be posting small expository soundbites on a variety of topics. The goal is to provide some interesting tidbits that introduce some topics, explain some concepts, or contribute some thoughts.

The name "Measure Zero" is sort of a double entendre: on one hand, it is a mathematical term; on the other hand, it refers the 2-D nature of digital media. As you can probably guess, many of the posts will either be related to mathematics (and by extension computer science and physics) or the world of anime and video games.
