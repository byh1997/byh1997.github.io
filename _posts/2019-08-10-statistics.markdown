As you probably know, **statistics** involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Of course, that's a very vague definition: science can be described in the same way. What, then, distinguishes statistics? Let's first introduce two concepts. 

A **statistic** is a summary of data. For example, if you flip a coin ten times, the number of heads is a statistic. Instead of remembering the entire sequence *HTHTTHHTHH*, all you need to remember is *6*. 

A **hypothesis test** is a method of assessing the validity of an explanation (the *null hypothesis*). For example, to test if a coin is fair, you might flip it ten times. If the coin comes up heads every single time, then the coin is probably unfair.

Statistics is the result of combining the two. Instead of inspecting the entire sequence to determine if the coin is fair, reading the statistic (the number of heads) is enough. 

Of course, no test is perfect: if the coin is indeed fair, there's still a chance that you'd think the coin is unfair if all the flips were heads by chance.
