As you probably know, **statistics** involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Of course, that's a very vague definition: science can be described in the same way. What, then, distinguishes statistics? Let's first introduce two concepts. 

A **statistic** is a summary of data. For example, if you flip a coin ten times, the number of heads is a statistic. Instead of remembering the entire sequence *HTHTTHHTHH*, all you need to remember is *6*. 

A **hypothesis test** is a method of assessing the validity of an explanation. For example, to test if a coin is fair, you might flip it ten times. If the coin comes up heads every single time, then the coin is probably unfair.

Statistics combines the two. To test if the coin is fair, you might reason that if the number of heads is 0, 1, 9, or 10, the coin is unfair.
