    <b>3.</b> I love it when you improv on the piano. The jazzy chords are a nice, fresh, sound for me. I also could not stop using the IV-iv-I progression you taught me during MUS213. I also love getting to tell you what style to improv in. I also like the fact that I'm still better at classical piano :P so we can both learn from each other. And lastly, watching you having fun playing whatever comes into your mind on the piano makes me really happy.
