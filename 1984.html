    <b>6.</b> I love the feeling of being proud of the fact that we're dating. I love being able to tell others that my girlfriend is Cindy -- I mean, who wouldn't? I also remember being proud when, sometime around April, I had two dreams where (from what I remember remembering) girls were horny for me but I just told them, no thanks, I have Cindy (100% winrate so far). They spanned the gamut of scenarios, from hot strangers to former crushes, and I remember thinking, my subconscious agrees that you're the one I want to be with (lol). Also, tagging you in memes on SAT is fun.
